# CS203_MetroApp

This project is for CS203 Assessment 2, it is a revamp for the Metro website in NZ, as Metro doesn't have a dedicated app for people to use, we took the oppourtunity to make this one aas a proof of concept.
With this app, users can create an account, lgoin with that account, then top up their Metro account balance, and use the app to check the bus zones, fares within those zones, and if they're eligible for student or senior discounts.

This app when hosted, has broken error messages, the messages return type is a JSON and the host website can't handle that can't of return type for some reason.
